[00:00] if you're the kind of person who's good
[00:02] at a bunch of different things and you
[00:03] work in a large corporation you're going
[00:05] to see a lot of things that you could do
[00:08] a lot of projects that you could do
[00:10] you're going to be asked to do a bunch
[00:12] of projects that that are a little bit
[00:14] outside of what you were hired for and
[00:16] what your your your box is your realm is
[00:21] my advice you can do whatever you want
[00:23] but typically volunteering for project
[00:27] after project will get you into a lot of
[00:29] trouble more trouble than it's worth if
[00:32] you like doing those projects and you're
[00:33] not really worried about compensation or
[00:35] worried about moving up or so fine do
[00:37] all the projects you want but it's
[00:39] typically not going to help you get
[00:42] promoted not going to help you get a
[00:44] raise it often detracts from your
[00:48] performance review and I'll tell you why
[00:50] in this video so this is for people who
[00:54] are working at the big Corporation
[00:57] complex organization thousands of people
[01:00] working there right this isn't for
[01:02] General Contractors this isn't for
[01:04] people working in construction or in a
[01:06] startup or a so Proprietor in those
[01:09] situations being a person with many hats
[01:12] is super helpful super helpful if you're
[01:14] in construction as I was in my in my uh
[01:17] teens and 20s you know you look at
[01:19] something and you're like hey I got to
[01:20] fix that and you go and fix that that's
[01:22] appreciated same with a small business
[01:25] and same with a startup they don't have
[01:27] all the processes in place they don't
[01:29] have all the the box is in place and and
[01:31] the organization designed to do what
[01:35] it's meant to do it's it these are
[01:37] simple organizations and you can do that
[01:41] I'm talking about big corporate life big
[01:45] companies say over over you know a
[01:47] thousand 10,000 employees that sort of
[01:50] Corporation because in that everybody
[01:53] every box that you're in is designed to
[01:56] make the whole organism work and and and
[01:59] granted it's a organism you don't want
[02:01] people you know going and doing
[02:03] different things uh that that they
[02:05] weren't hired for even though you might
[02:07] say it even though the manager might
[02:09] want you to do it the corporation does
[02:11] not right it's it's like a complex
[02:13] organization like a like your your human
[02:15] body right the the red blood cell is a
[02:17] red blood cell they do what red blood
[02:19] cells do if all of a sudden a red blood
[02:21] cell wakes up one day and it's like oh
[02:23] gee I'm going to fight off a virus like
[02:25] a white blood cell nobody's gonna like
[02:28] that and you will probably
[02:31] not survive the the the effort same
[02:33] thing with the large corporation do what
[02:36] you are hired to do that is your box
[02:39] that box was designed for you that's
[02:42] what you're doing is that boring yes but
[02:45] it might free you up if you if you have
[02:48] the kind of mind that can think about
[02:50] multiple things typically you can get
[02:53] that job done in a couple hours a day
[02:56] okay so use that to your advantage in
[02:58] whatever way you want to use the extra
[03:01] time and do other things most corporate
[03:04] jobs are
[03:07] easy okay so especially if you're if
[03:10] you're you know gifted you're
[03:11] intelligent you you uh have multiple
[03:14] talents most corporate
[03:17] jobs easy you could finish them in two
[03:19] hours a day really and the rest is
[03:22] networking the rest is like making
[03:24] people think that you're busy and so on
[03:26] now not always or meetings oh my God so
[03:30] many meetings for for no reason no
[03:32] reason if you're just given the ability
[03:33] to make decisions you don't need you
[03:35] don't need meetings that's a whole other
[03:37] video volunteering for other things you
[03:40] don't want to do it you really don't
[03:42] I'll let you know why first of all you
[03:44] might think that this helps performance
[03:46] review you might think like I'm going to
[03:48] be the go-getter I'm going to be the guy
[03:51] uh or or woman gal who who you know goes
[03:54] out and say I'm going to yes sir I'm
[03:56] going to do that project oh hey there's
[03:58] something that'll really help the
[03:59] company
[04:00] now in your performance revieww whether
[04:03] it's it's by anually every six months or
[04:05] every every year or
[04:07] so people aren't going to look at 15
[04:11] different projects that you did in the
[04:13] last period they don't care you you
[04:16] might have a uh depending on the company
[04:19] you probably have a performance commit
[04:21] Review Committee you might have a a
[04:23] promotion committee whatever and these
[04:25] guys have about 30 seconds to think
[04:28] about you maybe a minut it really and
[04:31] then the rest of the time they're
[04:32] thinking about promoting their own
[04:34] people they're thinking about their own
[04:36] promotion they're thinking about writing
[04:37] reviews and they don't care and I've
[04:39] been a manager for for for all kinds of
[04:42] groups big small whatever they don't
[04:45] care they are not going to look at the
[04:47] 20 wonderful projects even if they are
[04:51] amazing projects even if they are like
[04:55] they are like gamechanging projects you
[04:58] get to three of them in one of these
[05:00] committee meetings everybody shuts off
[05:03] everybody and it doesn't matter if it's
[05:05] a year if it's six months everybody
[05:07] shuts off so you're looking at three
[05:10] three big accomplishments that that you
[05:13] need to show at the end of that
[05:15] performance review and that you need to
[05:18] say that you can can translate super
[05:21] easily to your manager who has you know
[05:24] you know seven 10 other direct reports
[05:27] that they got to got to fight for for a
[05:29] motion and there are three things that
[05:32] manager needs to be able to articulate
[05:35] what you did your impact and boom boom
[05:38] boom amazing person three things if you
[05:42] have 20 they can be outrageously
[05:44] interesting projects they could have
[05:47] they could have increased ebit do at the
[05:49] company by you know
[05:51] 30% all all 20 of them they're going to
[05:53] get to three of them they're not going
[05:55] to go through 20 projects for the past
[05:57] year you might think they do they might
[06:00] tell you they do they don't they don't
[06:02] at all I'm telling you it's a waste of
[06:05] time now that said if you like doing
[06:07] these projects and you're like I don't
[06:09] care about you know compensate I don't
[06:11] care about these other things great good
[06:13] do go go you know do the
[06:16] projects but you're likely not going to
[06:18] get it you know reflected positively on
[06:21] your performance review what it's going
[06:22] to come over as is oh my God this guy's
[06:25] got like a ton of of projects they they
[06:29] they can't possibly be meaningful
[06:31] because he's done 20 everybody else does
[06:33] three maybe four when this guy's done 20
[06:36] they got to be little projects because
[06:38] nobody is able to do 20 meaningful
[06:41] projects but if you're smart if you're
[06:44] capable if you actually are A Cut Above
[06:49] the the rest of the you know whatever
[06:50] you call them mid wits uh you know
[06:53] corporate drones NPCs whatever if you
[06:57] were cut above that you absolutely abely
[07:00] can do 10 projects 20 projects uh during
[07:03] that time that are very meaningful
[07:05] nobody's going to believe you nobody is
[07:08] going to believe you so right there if
[07:11] you like doing them great if you know
[07:13] but if you're hoping to get you know
[07:15] like why so many people I speak to are
[07:18] like I've done so many projects I've
[07:19] been volunteering for all kinds of
[07:21] things why am I not getting
[07:23] promoted maybe because you're
[07:25] volunteering for too many projects focus
[07:28] on three three projects that are so easy
[07:32] to explain say this is what the person
[07:35] did right this is the formula it's so
[07:38] easy just turn your brain off for a sec
[07:40] this is what they did this is the impact
[07:43] and b boom that's it three of them
[07:45] that's all you need and then write them
[07:47] up for your manager this is what I did
[07:49] this is the project and what I did is
[07:51] impact boom boom that's it that's it
[07:54] three of
[07:55] them so that's the first one you're not
[07:58] going to get promoted by 20 amazing
[07:59] projects even if they are amazing
[08:01] nobody's going to believe you
[08:03] second if you start volunteering for
[08:06] other projects and in other people's
[08:09] domains oh people be welcoming they'll
[08:11] be like oh yeah okay that sounds like a
[08:14] good idea uh you know like you you can
[08:17] help me in in finan or or you know even
[08:19] though you are in customer service sure
[08:22] okay yeah run that project they will
[08:24] resent you for it now think about their
[08:28] point of view
[08:29] most people in large companies did not
[08:32] start out in construction they did not
[08:35] start out in small businesses they did
[08:37] not start out in in a uh in a startup
[08:41] right where everybody's jostling trying
[08:43] to just get things done they came right
[08:45] out of college with whatever degree they
[08:47] got you know socioeconomic history of
[08:50] the kangaroo whatever it is and they
[08:53] went right into Corporate America or
[08:55] corporate Europe or corporate Asia and
[08:57] they're like hey give me my job and and
[08:59] they get their box they get their
[09:01] cubicle they sit down and that is their
[09:04] world they don't they cannot think
[09:07] outside the box because they don't even
[09:09] know they're in a box they don't even
[09:11] know there's a box they can say the
[09:13] words we got to think out of the box we
[09:15] got a good they don't even know they're
[09:17] in a box so so they are they their whole
[09:22] world is right there and I don't want to
[09:24] belittle people in corporations they're
[09:26] plenty of smart people in corporations
[09:28] it's that's not the point right but but
[09:30] generally generally they're they're
[09:33] maximizing the strategy of of doing
[09:36] their Cog work there being the red blood
[09:39] cell and if you come in even if you're
[09:41] super smart especially if you're super
[09:43] smart and and and or and super capable
[09:46] and you have all these credentials they
[09:49] are going to be worried about you
[09:52] because they know for sure they're not
[09:54] doing their job as efficiently as they
[09:56] could they know it everybody is and it's
[09:58] not necessarily their fault sometimes it
[10:01] is but they know in their heart of
[10:03] hearts whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[10:04] whoa whoa this guy or gal comes in and
[10:07] talks with
[10:08] me and starts digging into my domain my
[10:13] box that's not a box and they're going
[10:16] to find all these skeletons they're
[10:17] going to
[10:19] find that that I've been working just a
[10:21] few hours a day they they're going to
[10:23] find out that I'm not as efficient as I
[10:26] my manager saying that I am and they
[10:28] will not like that I'm telling you they
[10:31] will they will smile to your face say
[10:34] sure yeah oh yeah I'd love to help but
[10:37] they will they will not be happy so
[10:39] there's all kinds of things that that
[10:41] can lead to right they they start up uh
[10:44] you know start up talking with other
[10:45] people but oh I don't know about that
[10:47] guys you know a little bit weird they
[10:50] they might uh be defensive they might be
[10:52] passive aggressive that happens a lot
[10:55] like you know hey I'd really like some
[10:57] data for blah blah blah blah oh yeah
[10:59] sure yeah we'll get you that data you
[11:00] know a week goes by hey do you have that
[11:03] data oh you know what yeah sure I get
[11:05] you that data right and two months later
[11:07] your project is hamstrung your project
[11:09] is dead that you just promised your
[11:12] manager you would do because that person
[11:15] is not giving you the data or the work
[11:17] or the whatever that you are asking for
[11:21] and at that point can you go to your
[11:23] manager and be like hey you remember
[11:25] that project that I signed up for and
[11:27] said was going to you know going to take
[11:29] a couple weeks of just some analysis
[11:31] well it's 3 months later and uh you know
[11:34] I don't I don't have the data from from
[11:36] that person and uh and and this person's
[11:38] taking too long to give me stuff and and
[11:40] I can't do that and the sun was in my
[11:42] eyes and I tripped on my shoelace and no
[11:44] that's all they're going to hear is just
[11:46] excuses hey he never asked you to do it
[11:49] maybe he did you can always say no I'll
[11:51] get to that but but if you're
[11:53] volunteering if you're like hey I'm
[11:55] going to go do this it's only downside
[11:58] risk you you're not asked to do it
[12:00] especially if you're not asked to do it
[12:02] you got downside because now okay you've
[12:05] signed up for a project and if that
[12:08] project doesn't go swimmingly guess what
[12:11] that's not one of your top three that's
[12:13] not one of the things that you can put
[12:14] on your on your performance review and
[12:16] be like look at what I did no you'd be
[12:18] like hey Sally and finance isn't giving
[12:20] me the
[12:22] data uhuh you can't you can't say that
[12:27] right so even if the project goes
[12:30] amazingly right and you're doing this
[12:32] cross functional project and you got
[12:34] everybody motivated this happens this
[12:36] for sure
[12:39] happens you're out of your box you're
[12:42] out of your box you're being evaluated
[12:45] on how well you do your box things
[12:48] you're not being evaluated typically
[12:51] they might say you are then you're not
[12:54] you're not being evaluated on what you
[12:56] can do for Sally's organization nobody
[12:58] cares there's no there's no there's no
[13:01] checklist for that so they're like oh
[13:04] yeah you know think about performance
[13:06] review time right everybody gets so
[13:08] nervous about performance review it's
[13:10] easy you got three things maybe five
[13:14] three things that are like knock out of
[13:16] the park anything after that nobody has
[13:18] an idea even at Google Microsoft you
[13:22] know whatever if you're a cog an
[13:24] executive or whatever you got three
[13:26] things big things focus on the those and
[13:30] if you're like you know your manager
[13:32] think about your manager's perspective
[13:34] right you go he or she's going into the
[13:36] performance review and you got you got
[13:38] 15 projects they're like oh my God like
[13:41] what am I going to do like how how do I
[13:43] get this into 30 seconds they can't they
[13:46] can't be like oh well you know he he he
[13:49] revamped the uh the the the finance
[13:51] department but why'd he do that he's in
[13:54] customer service oh well he he he he
[13:57] liked it it improved fin
[13:59] why' he do that this is the customer
[14:01] service performance review right how
[14:04] what's his ticket volume what's his you
[14:06] know that's the metrics that they care
[14:09] about so so
[14:12] okay look don't volunteer for extra work
[14:16] just just don't do it just put it out
[14:18] and don't be the one running around and
[14:20] being like you know this and that how do
[14:22] I know cuz I was that guy for years
[14:25] still am that guy kind of right I I like
[14:28] I personally I like working on multiple
[14:31] things I like you know uh going into
[14:35] other places where I'm like oh yeah you
[14:36] know what I can get some uh some insight
[14:39] I have some insight from other domains
[14:41] that I can apply to that and and at a
[14:44] consulting company like BCG I worked at
[14:47] for like four years that actually kind
[14:50] of sort of works there's still the box
[14:51] but it's it's a little broader right at
[14:54] startups that works in construction that
[14:57] works right small business
[14:59] great at a large
[15:01] corporation you end up with 20 amazing
[15:04] projects and nobody cares there are
[15:06] three that they focus on and those three
[15:08] I you know like if there's if there's 20
[15:11] you're not going to get three like knock
[15:13] them out of the park projects that
[15:15] people can talk about even if they're
[15:16] knock it out of the park even if they're
[15:18] amazing you're not going to get it
[15:19] because because they can't focus on
[15:21] those three they got 20 and they're like
[15:24] they don't know what to do
[15:26] so don't go running around volunteering
[15:29] If your manager asks you to do stuff
[15:33] okay so this is a common thing your
[15:34] manager asks you to do you know
[15:37] something that's outside your domain you
[15:40] can say no you can say oh I'm a bit
[15:45] packed with my three projects that I'm
[15:47] working on I don't have bandwidth for
[15:50] the rest now you have to make a decision
[15:52] about whether what your manager is going
[15:54] to say about that and so on you won't
[15:56] get fired you're still doing what you
[15:58] you're you know brought to do um and if
[16:00] this is extra work you need to think
[16:03] about it very seriously if this is going
[16:07] to lead to one of those three projects
[16:10] if if it is
[16:12] great take it on and swap out something
[16:15] else that you thought was one of the top
[16:17] three if it's not if it's number four or
[16:19] number seven or number 20 no thanks I'm
[16:23] full that's fully valid because part of
[16:26] the problem is that if you keep saying
[16:28] saying yes to all these crazy projects
[16:31] that your manager comes up with or this
[16:34] everybody's going to start asking you
[16:35] for for doing stuff everybody and you're
[16:38] going to end up saying oh yeah sure oh
[16:40] that sounds interesting yeah sure I'll
[16:42] do that that sounds great oh yeah sure
[16:44] you know oh yeah I I I I did that in in
[16:47] a in a high school uh you know science
[16:51] class or math whatever and you end up
[16:53] with 20 projects or five or 10 whatever
[16:57] too many and and there's only downside
[17:01] if any one of them slips if if if they
[17:03] all go amazingly nobody cares because
[17:05] they're focusing on three and but if any
[17:08] one of them slips guess what that this
[17:11] like friendly like oh yeah you know no
[17:13] problem come in now help us that's going
[17:15] to end in a second because they know
[17:18] that they can now throw you under the
[17:20] bus that's how it works that's how it
[17:23] works so if you are if you are you know
[17:27] highly above average in intelligence I
[17:30] don't care about IQ but if you are if
[17:32] you see that you can do all of these
[17:35] things and you can do multiple domains
[17:38] and you know but it's all pretty easy it
[17:42] is this is not going to help you this is
[17:45] and and it's often confusing for people
[17:48] like that that have these you know that
[17:50] have higher ability because they think
[17:53] they're helping they think well yes sure
[17:55] is help and I I've fallen into this as
[17:57] well you think oh yeah yeah I'm I'm
[17:59] helping everybody
[18:00] out they know they don't want your help
[18:04] they don't want your help they you stick
[18:06] to your three things be a red blood cell
[18:08] I know it's boring but if you want some
[18:10] more you if you want to wear different
[18:12] hats start a company join a startup join
[18:15] a small business they pay less typically
[18:18] but you're able to get a little bit more
[18:21] satisfaction from multiple uh roles and
[18:23] multiple jobs so I hope this helps and I
[18:28] hope you're having having a great day
[18:30] I'd love to hear your comments if you
[18:32] like this kind of uh content like And
[18:34] subscribe really happy to see uh the
[18:36] community growing here and I hope you're
[18:39] having a fantastic day no matter what
[18:41] projects you're working on you're making
[18:43] decisions for yourself and you're
[18:45] realizing the consequences and I hope
[18:48] that you yeah just enjoying life so till
[18:52] the next one talk to you then bye
