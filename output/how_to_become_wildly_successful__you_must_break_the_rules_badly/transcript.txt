you can do very well for yourself working a normal corporate job focusing on your career working up the corporate ladder you can make actually a lot of money you can have a very comfortable life but if you want to really be in the top tier if you if you really want to Excel and make the big money you have to break rules and you have to break big rules and you have to be evil and I'm going to talk today about examples across the board of how breaking the rules is the way to go if you really want to ascend to the highest levels of Industry wealth power whatever it is and it it saddens me to to make this video but it's it's absolutely true I coach people every day to maximize their careers and and help them in their lives to get the goals that they want and honestly if you if you're following the rules you can do this you you can you you you just need to find what what the value is that you're offering package it in the right way and keep pushing get get that direction that you're looking for and go for it but if you think that that's going to make you massive amounts of wealth you're wrong you're absolutely wrong you're not going to make massive amounts of wealth by following the rules you're not going to make the get to the highest points of Industry by following the rules and if you think you're going to get it from some online seminar of somebody who's like I'm so rich I'm going to teach you how to be a rich you're an idiot you an idiot you should just give me your money now because you don't deserve it you you're not going to get some online course that helps you become rich overnight you might make a little money you might uh you know buy a couple houses and flip them and so on but that's not the real wealth that's not that's not you know 78 n figures how do you get that by being absolutely evil now when I say this it's it's evil you know I I I've evil is different for for everybody and we can justify we're so good at justifying what we do is like oh well it's not evil because of this and that but I've traveled all around the world I've lived all around the world and one of the reasons I love that is because in different cultures they have a different idea of what good and evil is fundamentally different than what I would have as an American and I I first notic this going to the Netherlands it it just just different subtle but different there are other places very different China very different idea of what good and evil is so so when I say evil it's basically breaking some rules breaking breaking the bigger the rules the more evil you are and this includes everything so if you want to get rich if you want to get fabulously wealthy first of all don't come to me as as a career consultant as a as a coach because I'm very happy living by the rules I I I get nervous if I have a a a cheap Mouse from some company that I forgot to return even though I know they can't use it I I still feel guilty that's me that's me I like I like quiet peaceful life I don't need tons and tons and tons of wealth but if you do you got to start early and you got to break the rules and and you're not going to do it with some cabal of of tons of people you're going to do it alone and you are going to relentlessly pursue the goal of fabulous wealth no matter what the cost no matter what you have to do no matter who you got to kill no matter what kind of lines you got to cross that's how you do it and I'll give you some some good examples this came to a head to me this this really struck me uh a bit ago I was talking to a friend of mine and um and he has a couple of businesses successful business this guy's successful guy right and think tens of millions uh but not billions not hundreds of millions still has a you know the company's always have cash crunches and so on and this guy's a righteous guy no not nobody's righteous nobody's perfect but this guy he does the right thing he he treats his employees well he he does not bribe people to get you know uh things into their companies uh even though he could even though the rest of the market is doing it and he sees it and he sees how they take off he doesn't get Kickbacks like all this stuff he just he keeps his hands clean I totally respect that totally respect that but he he he he turned to me we were having U coffee uh one day and he and he turns to me and and and almost with the with the look of somebody who has just realized or is coming to the realization that that he has been playing the game wrong and he and he says you know we're talking about his business and and and different things and he said you know you you just can't really really succeed without being really evil and he was and he was really like it was this realization for him and over over the next couple weeks as I thought about that it became a realization for me as I as I thought about examples of of people who have become fabulously wealthy who have really you know broken through that barrier they they don't care who they hurt and this happens in in the micro and in the macro and again please don't get me wrong you can have a wonderful life you can have you know everything that you possibly need in a Life by living by the rules right you find a job that that suits you well find a career hop you know there there's techniques there's thing you hop jobs you you you keep looking for that uh that next uh promotion pay raise you move geographies you can do it right depending on what you want to uh want to sacrifice there but he's right he's so right you don't you don't get into that upper echelon without really doing some evil stuff okay so so a couple examples right and a couple examples um and it again it depends on what you think of as evil but uh but Google for instance now Google has always had the the the line uh you know don't be evil well that's good I I love that line but then they changed it to do the right thing now do the right thing what does that even mean right do the right thing for the company do the right thing for you know your your aunt Joanie like what is what does that even mean and um and this all happened when there was a big who about you know you have the best engineers in the world at Google and uh and they uh you know they're all working on on search or marketing or what really benign stuff and and AI oh they love AI we're look working on AI and it's very important and so on turns out this is like 2016 or something that they had been working without knowing it without knowing this is compartmentalization and if you don't think you can be working on something without knowing it they perfected this with the atom bomb 400,000 people worked on the atom bomb and nobody knew what they were doing because our enemies never found out about it so they're good they they're good at doing this so it turns out that that all these passive you know these these pacifist Engineers were working on weapon systems project Maven you can look it up but basically they were doing AI to do image recognition of soft targets for drone strikes this this in Obama years um that they were doing this when you know Obama increased the drone strikes in in the Middle East now is that evil right it was a big brewhaha it was a big deal in in Google and people went people went bananas I remember the the meetings and so on the the tgfs and people people were upset because they had been duped they had been working on weapon systems the company said oh yeah you're working on AI it's the future Tech uh no they were working on weapon systems to kill people in the Middle East flat out and kill them very efficiently without even a human you know figuring out human could be sleeping they get a beep and say oh yeah here's somebody you want boom H now in the spirit of is that evil right it's difficult because if you're if you're pro-military great good right I mean like I I I get that right weapon systems are cool right let's turn the other hat uh put my put my black hat on my gray hat uh rather than my white hat and and the the weapon systems are cool and that's a great engineering problem wow that is like how can you get a a autonomous drone to fly around and like and like throw a a projectile at a mark right that you you identify as as a key Target that's a that's a cool engineering problem right I like to solve that but the result is you you know you just destroyed a wedding and and all the collateral damage that that entails and so on right you can you can make the AI minimize it and so but that's what they were working on and they were freaked out and they all they were all told no no no no no we don't do that another example is prism right so Edward Edward Snowden uh comes up in I forget when it was 200 I don't know 10 12 8 whatever but he comes up and says hey you know what the the NSA has been has been spying on everybody for ages oh really yeah they're not supposed to but they have been how do they do this well that at the Google data centers there's a little piece where it's all encrypted and in the data center it's all encrypted but there's this little piece where it magically becomes unencrypted and that's where they tapped in they knew exactly where they how do you think they knew where to go like like you don't get into a data center they have armed guards there they you you do not get into a data center of any one of these big companies I don't mean to pick on Google it's just a you know examples that I know for sure for sure they knew this was happening for sure you you know hey who are those guys in the black in the Black jumpsuits like what what are they doing here oh I don't know Girl Scouts selling cookies right no no no no no no they got they got liar they got they got heat uh tracking cameras they they know for sure who is on their property and somehow there's this little piece where it's unencrypted and the government magically gets that information no no my favorite Story one of them is it's kind of a silly cute one is uh is way in the beginning right and and and and uh way in the beginning of Google and uh uh they were they were you know they were going great and if you don't know uh I think the CIA or DARPA sponsored uh laran serus PhD don't quote me on that but is that evil I don't know I don't know I mean if you're Pro America and you want you know projection of power and stuff I get it I I totally get it right there's there's a non-evil it depends what the goal is but but the the stories that were told the're BS but um but but you know do no evil right um the in the beginning uh know search was taken off and and and and people you know I don't know if you're around in in 1999 2000 but Google was hot all of a sudden you went from Alta Vista and as geves and all this to Google that actually under seem to magically understand what you're looking for now it's terrible now it's all ads but back then it was like we are pure search and we are you can ask for anything okay all right what are people going to ask for well well Larry Paige he's a nice guy he thought it would be a good idea to uh to put on the uh on the big screen on above the the reception all the Search terms that people are looking for okay okay sounds like a good idea like you know and and it would scroll on you know in the in the in the lobby of main lobby of Google all the search it was very proud you know proud moment to to to see all the things that people are searching for and it was filled with the most vile like pornography searches that you can imagine I mean fied filed and that's what that's one of the things that that brought you know Google up is the ability to find porn now you can't even say the word right you can't like now it's like on YouTube like oh I might get demonetized because they but that's the origin of the entire company right and and then you know people like Alex Jones and so on they made huge huge huge money on on Google and YouTube and and so on in the beginning you think they didn't know of course they knew now again if you like porn great good you found porn what's wrong with that if you like Alex Jones great fine get to see Alex Jones what's wrong with that so but but the the point is you got to break the rules you have to break the rules ignore the rules they don't apply to me and you can see this in in all kinds of things right the uh the uh uh San bankman freed Saga where they they were doing just completely Shady stuff like completely you have a you have insider trading on on on crypto on a crypto exchange you have uh you know undisclosed loans that are going out money that's being you know brought from from customer accounts and being sent into a trading firm um almea trading and then and then the uh Ellison the uh uh the the CEO there was just trading on on other people's funds not telling anybody anything and pumping up the uh uh The Exchange whoa whoa and somehow right when this all gets kind of unraveled when when crypto gets loses its luster um you know uh the the CEO of Al Ellison Al Ellison she's like she's like oh I'm so sorry oh my gosh why why should it matter if somebody's crying right in in the law why why should it matter so she gets a couple years right she spills the beans to everybody everybody else is like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Z bankman Freed's like I don't know what I did wrong I don't think I did wrong what's your problem he gets 25 years when he gets found out but if he didn't get found out you know that that company goes public they make billions of dollars and then you lawyer up that's how the game works you break all the rules you you you you kill your competition you move out and then you lawyer up and you lock up so now Google is one of the highest pay highest uh lobbyist the biggest lobbyist in Washington they are paying politicians they're doing everything they can to be uh to to have their hands off right to to you know to to regulatory capture right to to capture the regulations so that they don't uh they're not subject to them they're changing the rules so they break the rules in the beginning only to change them later uh what else Facebook right so so by all accounts Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea he was he was given contract work from the Winkle boss boss twins you remember the Winkle boss Twins and uh and this is work for hire so it belongs to them that is their idea he implemented it but big deal it's their idea and then he takes it and he stole it from all accounts he stole it straight up stole it be like yeah buy now okay is that evil Thou shalt not steal right is that is that bad yeah it's not it's not one of the Ten Commandments I don't think I don't know but um yeah stole it and now he is one of the richest men in the world huh interesting you know this and this goes down to like you know even Facebook ads right or Facebook Marketplace people complain to me that you can't find what you're looking for they don't want you to find what they're looking you're looking for because the time on site is more time for you to see ads so they they trickle feed the the the good results to you so that you stay on the site more and they have algorithms the algorithm is basically to keep you on site so you see more ads see more ads you make more money that's kind of evil but if you're Facebook it's not you're just you're just you're just an organism that is trying to maximize profit ethics don't apply so you know I I'm sure we could all come up with examples of people that have become you know quite Rich doing something you know Bitcoin or something like that but the whole Bitcoin thing took out off because people were trying to break the rules in China the whole reason Bitcoin went went uh um exponential is because people in China could not get their money out of China postseason ping they they there were all kinds of currency controls how do I know I lived there uh and I and you can't get your money out you have like $50,000 a year so you have to think of all kinds of clever ways to do it so what they could do is Farm Bitcoin in China and make a deal with the power companies so they they have Excess power and the coal plants in the middle of China make a bitco uh coin farm and then and then get the Bitcoin and then sell them uh externally on on the open market that's how it took off and then everybody's like oh my goodness that this has value w wow and I'm sure there are all kinds of crypto Bros that are going to be you know screaming how much value it has fine whatever it's going to take a while for this to to dissipate and and people realize that there's nothing there couple of financial crisis whatever but um but that is why it went up and then after that everybody's like it has value okay but they were breaking the rules to to try and make that money and lots of people made a lot of money right nft is the same thing all kinds of stuff and the people that are selling you these online courses about how to get rich they get rich from selling you the online courses it's the stupidest thing if you are if you are considering some get rich scheme or University or the hustlers or whatever stop it they are getting rich they are laughing at you because they're getting rich from promising you how to get rich it's the oldest scam in the book so look this this goes in in corporate life as well you got to be a killer to get to the top you got to be a killer now you know I I know so many people that are like oh yeah you know I've met our CEO he's a really nice guy he has no reason not to be nice to you you're not a threat you're not in his way but if you are look out and and if you are willing to do absolutely anything to get that money or that power and you you will you will get rid of anybody in your way that's how you do it now there's risk there and you make enemies and all that okay fine it's all part of the game that's why it is a game right because you got to you got to defend yourself and you got to attack and so on and and and the bigger risks you take the bigger reward there is and most of us are not really willing to take those risks break those rules hurt those those people right I'm not I'm not I mean you can see this all in every company that that's existed right I mean from you know Philip Morris suppressing uh information on on smoking uh and and the link with cancer to to you know fiser and the and the vaccines and all the you know the clotting problems and so on they downplay that you know at the same time we had a vaccine made everybody happy like I don't know what's evil what's what you know is it gray hat is it white hat black hat I don't know I don't know I even have this in you know in some of my uh um uh Consulting that I do and and and you know that I've done in the past and so on where where you know I go into companies and and the industry that they're in is is doing stuff they're not supposed to they're breaking the the the rules that that are set up by the game and so on and when I notice this I say Hey look the game is not the game you think you're playing everybody's playing a different game they got gloves off they are they it is a street fight you guys are playing like you know like like t-ball in in the uh in the suburbs these guys are on the street they're they're ripping each other apart and they're doing stuff that that you're not even thinking about so you got to decide if you're going to play that game and succeed or you get out cuz the game you're playing ain't the game that that that's really going on and you know what's evil I mean we're talking about you know that's subtle nobody's getting hurt right but but are they so so it comes down a little bit to the the definition of evil but uh it is if if you want to get up high right sea level CEO uh level and so on you got to start young right that's that's that's a a big one the younger you start the more more chance you have and you got to be willing to do anything to reach that goal you got to keep that goal consistent you got to you know whatever that is I want to get there and and anything in your way you are getting rid of you are that is your goal you are getting rid of everything in your way no matter what and so with this and and this is true in politics as well this is you know just as it is in business you have to set that goal right that that's a that's a prerequisite and that that's something that a career coach like myself can help you with right set a goal you have to set a goal you got to set a goal in your heart I don't care if you write it down I don't care if you put it on PowerPoint it doesn't matter you have to know I'm going for that or at least that general direction get as as as focused as possible and I am going for that then it's easy because then you know if anything is not that out of my way if it's not that get out of here I'm I'm I'm going for that then it's a matter of how ruthless you're going to be how how much effort you are going to put in how how little you care about the people that are in your way or the the ethical considerations or whatever right don't know that's that's up to you I I can't I can't um you know give that sort of guidance I I think you know everybody has their own thing I I have my own ideas of what right and wrong is but I can't tell that for you so in all of this thinking it it makes me a little bit maybe depressed because it is true it is so true and it and it and it's so clear why things like Harvey Weinstein's Island right no Jeffrey abstein sorry Jeffrey Epstein's Island right we have an island with the most powerful the richest and most powerful people in the world going to an island and presumably doing all kinds of weird funky sexual stuff many times with underage people very underage and we hear about this and and we we hear like like some of the details that come out of that is very like what like disgusting just abhorent and and the News cycle lasts about 20 seconds until this guy's killed in federal prison you don't die in federal prison we're very good at keeping people alive right that's power that's real power this guy was fabulously wealthy how he gave he gave crazy fantasies to the rich and powerful and if you think he's the only one who does this you're crazy this happens all over the world happens in Europe America Asia all over the world and much worse than that and and give what I've I've just been talking about I can totally understand how people will sign up to that oh yeah you know or the the P Diddy parties right people are like oh my gosh there's you know there pay to play like you'd have to get into these compromising situations and then you go big in the music industry or movies or whatever yeah there are plenty of people that take that bet I get it I get it there's you know you you you got somebody that's saying hey make a deal with me you're willing to do anything to get where you want anything yeah I'll do anything okay so I get that I'm not participating in it it's not for me no no so back to my friend you know that that had this Revelation he's right you don't really get this fabulous wealth without being evil it's sad but it's true it's the world we live in maybe maybe someday this will change but it seems throughout history this has been the case and and you know part of it is that you you you're evil and that you're breaking rules you're breaking big rules until you get to a point of dominance and then you are you are rich and powerful and then you can change the rules right you go Lobby Congress to to change the rules so you're not you're not you're not being evil anymore and you can lawyer up to destroy anybody that comes in your way okay going to not being an evil what where are the accusations they're all gone and and this has happened throughout history this is you know you you you break all the rules like if you think you're going to get you know you can have a great life in corporate uh world you can have a wonderful career you can have a very fulfilled Family Life the whole thing interesting work everything for sure but if you think you're going to get fabulously wealthy doing it you're not you're not you got to you got to figure out the game of one that you are going to win maybe you have a partner that's in it with you but uh you got to go for it and this goes for you know you you want to do trading right I got a a bunch of people that talk about day trading stuff yes you can make some money sure but it's been proven time and time again that the that the uh or shown that the stock market is a random walk you can't you cannot predict it based on on the the data so how do you predict it insider trading right the the the the the penalties for insider trading are severe severe right this is having insider trading is is having information in from inside the company that should not be public but somebody has given you that you know what the results are uh before they come out so then you can trade either high or low um depending on that information and you know like Nancy Pelosi's husband you one of our Congress uh women uh is uh you know does tons better than the best stock Pickers in the world why is that right a politician um so so if you think you're going to get rich day trading you're you're you're joking yourself you're you're watching too many YouTube videos but if you get You Know Rich insid of trading that's the way to do it ouch ouch absolutely but you got to be clever about it huh not for me to do I don't want to do this I'm happy with my life but but because the penalties are severe the penalties if if you get caught insider trading even if you are any piece of the the the information chain that gets to somebody insider trading you can get prosecuted it's it's brutal but if you do it and nobody finds out who's to know that's how they play the game so you know people talk about Warren Buffett I don't know he seems like a nice guy I've never met him I don't know him but uh you know people were like oh he he's he's a wonderful man he's made you know tons of money and so on uh you know isn't he righteous right I get all these kind of comments and stuff I don't know but if you think that Warren Buffett doesn't get some Insider information every now and again passed to him for whatever reason you are naive he he he studies the management teams he he knows the management teams he meets them and he's Warren freaking Buffett he's he's a guy that that that the Fed chair called to bail out us the banks in 2008 that's power that's power so if you think for a second that he doesn't know what's going on inside companies you're very naive I'm naive too I like it I don't mind I don't mind I don't want any part of this stuff but that's how you do it and so yeah how you live your life is up to you as I say I travel around the world everybody has a different idea of Good and Evil and we're very good at justifying ourselves oh no it's going to help my family okay F then it's fine for you oh no you know like like uh smoking's not that bad so you know I can sell cigarettes okay that's fine right people choose to smoke they should have the freedom to smoke y okay I can't argue with that well all right good good Philip Morris go for it I'm uncomfortable with it I I I it is not the life that I want to lead personally and it's not the life that I want to counsel anybody to lead but that's how you do it so I hope you are having a great day I hope you are not doing anything shady because it's Shady and uh and just to get money and be fabulously wealthy but if you are send me some paper no I'm just kidding I'm I'm totally good I I I really hope that you are living the exact life that you want to lead and I I'm not I I don't judge I've stopped judging what people do many years ago seeing different cultures and how how different it is around the world I I don't know I haven't figured it out but I know you can have a wonderful life no matter what you're doing even with all the challenges that we have all the opportunities that we have it's amazing so I hope you're enjoying it taking advantage of of this amazing life and I will see you on the next one bye
