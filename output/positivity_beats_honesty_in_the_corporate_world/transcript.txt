so you're a thinking person in a corporation in a big company and you're above average intelligence and change comes how do you react to this change that you might not agree with but you don't you're not put in a position of power you're not asked about about what you should do you're basically told hey we are merging with this other company whatever the change may be merging with this other company we are going to change the division we're re structuring this what or or or we're going to build a new product line and you're part of the team your best bet even if you disagree with this your best bet is to say I'm in what a great idea let's go for it because if you if you start saying like H I don't know boss I don't know this this I'm nervous about this uh this this merger I I I don't think this new product line is really the way that we should go you are going to be pushed out you are going to be you are going to be squished in the the grinding Gears of of change so I'm going to talk today about how do you deal with with big change and and how you don't want to be a Negative Nancy or a negative Nathan on on these kind of change things and you should be more like an Elon Musk or a uh or a Sam Alman being like yeah let's go for it that's going to be great awesome even if it's not exactly what you think now look on these videos I explain what the game is I explain how people are thinking and and how they deal with with you know different options that you can do in your behavior you can choose what you want to do I I'm laying out the the rules of the game you can choose how you want to play that game and and it's it's there's no right answer there's no wrong answer you just do what you want to do but right here I I see a lot of people stumbling when big change comes and they're like they're like whoa whoa whoa whoa there's there's a few different reactions right when when when a big change comes to a company one is fear right one is like y I don't know what's going to happen to me I don't know what's going to happen to my job my Division I got friends here blah blah blah blah blah if you express that okay you know like like sure all kinds of companies have like oh yeah open door policy come and talk to me and you're getting negative points by going and complaining about the change coming up that change has all by the time it gets to you that change has already gone through all the layers of management to get to you they've already paid McKenzie or BCG millions of dollars to make the decision that makes the change to go all the way down the line to you and it doesn't matter if your middle management or whatever unless you are in the SE Suite making that decision that we're going to merge with this other company that's a big decision that's a big decision that is not a decision that you are going to to change unless you are in the sea Suite finding that Target company or you're in the the consulting company that's advising that if you're not in in those places your best bet career-wise work-wise is to shut up and get on board and be like that change that change looks great even if it's the dumbest change in the world you could always look for a new job if you really disagree be like great I'm all in I am all in cuz I'll get to why you you should do that but but your your best strategy is to be like that change sounds great let's go for it I'm in I am fully fully in and then March towards that there are a couple reasons for this one who cares if it's a if it's a good change or a bad change and who are you to judge who think about those two questions right so who one do you really care if you merge with another company I mean really why doesn't matter the only thing you care about is your job for instance so if that's the case protect your job right if that's the case go with the best strategy to protect your job so you really don't care if you you merge with your your Archen enemy company or whatever it is and they're all a bunch of jerks trust me I've been through this a number of times and there's fighting and whatever you need to stand up and be like yeah that's a good idea boss that sounds great great and the second thing is you don't know if it's a good idea or not you have no idea you have no idea you have no clue why they made that decision to uh to go and merge with the other company might be it might be to get the ebit dah from them right there's profitability from that other company it might be vertical integration so you buy a supplier and and that's where you get you get you you pull in their profit for your profit it might be to shut down the competition buy your competition before they grow big enough to buy you all valid reasons all good ideas or not but you're not going to be in a position to do that so don't complain about it it does no good go home complain with with your wife or your husband or your cat but don't complain at work because because this is what happens when you're when when the the management that your manager is in the same position you are he or she's been told that we're going to go do this and we got you got to get your team ready for the changes that are coming okay okay so if your manager is shrewd then you you know they're going to be like okay well who's on board here I got a team of 10 people let's say right it's a you know uh or seven people and they're like okay my job now is to get everybody ready for this new change so who the naughty people who are the nice people the the people on the team that they want to see are the people say wow good idea good idea let's go for it I'm on board I'm on board even if you don't even if you don't believe in the whole thing it's not your decision you have no judgment as to whether it's good or bad you might but keep it to yourself not your call it's not your call so if you if you're like yep I'm on board sounds great show me show me what to do and then 6 months down the road 12 months down the road you get you get laid off fine okay plan for that plan for that today you see this coming you're like okay well I got to reduce expenses I got to save some money and I'm looking for a new job uh because I'm starting to to brush up my resume because I know layoffs are a possibility great good but you complaining about it is probably going to increase your chances of getting laid off because you're not on on board with the new change they want people that are ready and willing and go and do it even if you think it it will lead to your layoffs so so that's the first thing your manager is in the same boat you are because because look if you're that positive person and this goes with everything in uh in Corporate America if and and the world if you're that positive person that manager is like good I don't have to worry about Judy Judy's on board great good now I got to deal with Greg and Greg is just complaining all the time shut up Greg please I got a job to do you got a job to do you don't like it leave right and in six months if you don't like it fine find another job there's no changing it there's no changing the the whole change that's happening and this goes as well with with product direction as well I see so many engineers and product owners product managers that that have this idea a like and I've been that person for sure for sure where they the the executives say we are going to do this we are going to expand our product line and and whether it's engineering or whatever and we are going to go in this direction and the engineers are like that's a terrible Direction I why would we do that and they Mumble and they argue and they they they think and they just murmur if if you if people in management hear this and they have the power out they will look to get rid of you there's no there's no like there's nothing good that comes of this the only thing that you need to do is say yeah great good show me show me the work I need to do tell me tell me my new reality and I'm going to jump in it sounds what does it sound sounds so superficial it sounds almost um uh it sounds it sounds deceitful right it sounds like untrue and it is welcome to corporate world you you you don't have that power if you don't have that power to make these decisions you don't have the power to complain about it all you can do is say yes that's I'm in I'm in and if you're not in find a new job later on and this goes with with all kinds of stuff being positive is more valued in in corporations than being honest and this is why this is one of the reasons why hyper intelligent people struggle in corporations did a whole video on that but this is one of the reasons because because there's an intellectual honesty that is completely broken when you are a cog in a machine you just in your reality that is that is the the truth and the honesty in that being that Cog it's not it's not in in in making these Grand decisions you not making those grand decisions and if you are if you in the committee or if you are in the group that are making these decisions and it doesn't go your way your best bet is to is you know you you you discuss the whole thing beforehand and the best bet is to flip and say okay that is what we are going for I'm in I'm fully in right and if you're not fully in wait six months or a year and then move on start looking in other jobs and and what you can do in your Marketplace because you're not changing this machine you're not changing cultural changes whatever it is so positivity is more valued than honesty in in a Corporation and and this is different for smaller companies but there's there's still similarities and if you don't really want to do this start your own thing you you can there's there's a zillion ways especially in America to do your own business and start be a be a a sole proprietor and do whatever you want to do that's an option but there's tradeoffs to that so when you're in a company when you're in a corporation and you see change coming get on board as fast as you can yeah I mean I'll do whatever you want I I will sure oh yeah you want me to change my job position okay sure sure and then you can figure out what you really want to do maybe you can find another place in the company or so on but if you start fighting it that option closes down if you start fighting it they start looking at you when they go for the round of layoffs layoffs are just a part of almost every change companies so if you're the one argument arguing everything if you're argumentative and you're like Negative Nancy let's find a way of getting rid of you so don't do it so I hope you are having a wonderful wonderful life I hope whatever you're doing you're having an awesome time whether it's in a in a career incorporation or doing your own thing business-wise or or you know sitting meditating somewhere in a field this life is amazing and I hope you're taking full advantage of it for your goals and what you think you your most awesome life is and with that I will see you on the next one bye
