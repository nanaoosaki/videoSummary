[00:00] care a bit less about your work
[00:03] especially if you're working in a large
[00:05] corporation or a a big business big
[00:08] company where there are multiple
[00:10] departments multiple decision makers on
[00:12] any one given task and if you are
[00:16] somebody who is on the upper end of the
[00:18] intelligence spectrum and you are you
[00:21] are concerned with the truth and the
[00:24] best outcome and so on you are you are
[00:27] probably caring a bit more then you
[00:30] should about what is the right answer
[00:33] rather than what is the together answer
[00:36] now I say that because I've I've I've
[00:40] mentored and counseled many many people
[00:41] and I see that on the higher end of the
[00:44] the intelligence Spectrum there's a
[00:46] frustration in large companies that
[00:49] people don't get it and I've spoken
[00:50] about this a little bit in other videos
[00:53] but the the advice that I typically give
[00:57] and this is because I've lived it I've
[00:59] I've
[01:00] tried many of the different ways I've
[01:02] worked in you know working for changing
[01:05] organizations and motivation and and
[01:08] designing uh uh performance reviews and
[01:10] so on my advice is to care less about
[01:16] that that perfect result and and
[01:19] fairness and and things that things that
[01:22] that are self-evident things that you
[01:24] know you value uh it's a terrible thing
[01:27] to say but but if you think about it
[01:29] You' you you put yourself voluntarily by
[01:32] getting into a large company you've put
[01:34] yourself into an authoritarian regime
[01:38] voluntarily they it is a a bit of a a
[01:41] feom all around like um surom or a
[01:46] dictatorship where you know orders come
[01:48] from the top down and everybody is is
[01:51] basically P paid to say yes sir or yes
[01:56] ma'am and you and you need to recognize
[01:59] that that
[02:00] that your say your part in this whole
[02:03] machine is very
[02:05] small it doesn't matter if you don't
[02:07] show up to work tomorrow and you live in
[02:08] a you work in a large company nobody
[02:11] really cares nobody really cares and
[02:14] that's by Design it's by design that we
[02:16] have this this redundancy that you are a
[02:19] cog in a in a huge machine that you have
[02:23] very little influence over it now I'm
[02:25] not talking if you're you know if you're
[02:27] super ambitious and you want to get into
[02:29] the C sweet and all of that okay it
[02:32] still works but if you are if you're you
[02:36] know going to work and and you're
[02:37] getting frustrated and you are
[02:39] intelligent and you are looking around
[02:42] at all the dummies around that are not
[02:44] making the right decision that is by
[02:47] Design there's an old expression that
[02:49] you know a a single person can go a uh
[02:53] very fast but together we can go very
[02:56] far and that holds true in companies I
[03:00] hate to use some sort of slogan or
[03:02] something like that but but that is the
[03:05] whole design of a corporation it's not
[03:08] about getting to the optimal answer it's
[03:10] getting to an answer that the whole
[03:12] group agrees on and this can be
[03:14] outrageously frustrating if you're
[03:16] looking for the right answer so so this
[03:19] is one of the reasons hyper intelligent
[03:22] people really struggle in large
[03:24] corporations unless they're you know at
[03:26] the very top and that you know to get
[03:28] there you have to be pretty ruthless you
[03:30] have to go through this this series of
[03:33] turning off this uh you know the the
[03:37] sense of fairness turning off a sense of
[03:40] getting to the right answer turning off
[03:42] this idea of like you are really making
[03:45] a difference and just focus on being
[03:47] that that incredible Cog and making
[03:53] connections
[03:54] so why why do I say making connections
[03:57] because nobody gets promoted based on
[03:59] their productivity okay nobody gets
[04:02] promoted because they come to the right
[04:04] answers no everybody and I mean
[04:07] everybody gets promoted because somebody
[04:10] says let's promote
[04:13] Joe that's it that's it it's either that
[04:16] somebody is either an individual who has
[04:18] that power or a group that has that
[04:20] power if if it's a promotion committee
[04:23] or something so the whole game is to get
[04:26] them to say yes if you're looking for
[04:28] promotion but even that is a farce so
[04:32] that is a carrot in front of your face
[04:33] that that typically it's it's not always
[04:36] worth it to run for now sometimes it is
[04:40] but typically people who Skip jobs every
[04:43] two years and move to another company
[04:45] make more money than people that stay in
[04:48] the same company for long term it's not
[04:50] always it's not always true but in the
[04:52] vast majority of cases it is so 2 years
[04:56] you should be looking especially if
[04:58] you're an early to mid career two years
[05:00] you should be looking to be at that
[05:02] company that's it and then and then be
[05:05] out of there for the next job why is
[05:07] that because all the next job cares
[05:09] about is you were in that position
[05:13] that's it they don't care how how you
[05:16] know productive you were they don't care
[05:18] how efficient you were they don't care
[05:21] if you got to the right answer or
[05:23] anything like that they don't all they
[05:25] care about is this oh wow you were a a
[05:28] senior engineer at at Ron well okay now
[05:33] at locked Martin you're going to be a
[05:35] senior senior engineer or you're going
[05:37] to be a manager or something like that
[05:40] that's all they care about so so you
[05:41] skip into the higher position in a
[05:44] different
[05:45] company companies internally don't like
[05:49] to promote their own people and if you
[05:52] and if you open your eyes to this you'll
[05:54] see this they talk so much about how
[05:58] promotion and performance reviews and
[06:01] I've seen this all over the place but
[06:03] really really it's a pain in the butt to
[06:07] promote somebody in the same group to
[06:10] then lead who you know the people that
[06:12] used to be his peers it's really it's a
[06:16] real pain for the company because the
[06:18] the the people that were there resents
[06:20] this this one person that that got up
[06:22] and oh I know Jim's not uh not you know
[06:25] he's not the most productive he's not
[06:27] the best engineer he's got to know why
[06:28] is he the lead team lead and all of that
[06:31] so they tend not to do it now if the
[06:34] company's big enough you can get
[06:36] promoted into another group but there's
[06:38] all kinds of internal policies to
[06:40] prevent that from happening typically in
[06:43] larger corporations why is that same
[06:45] kind of Reason like people will see you
[06:47] do a a skip into another group and
[06:49] they're like w I'm going to do that and
[06:52] then they try and Skip into another
[06:53] group and and all of a sudden it becomes
[06:55] this internal competition where people
[06:58] just stay in a rle and then and then
[07:00] leave the group uh for another group
[07:02] they don't want that they want you to
[07:04] stick in your little role in your in
[07:08] this authoritarian regime that you put
[07:10] yourself in voluntarily if you don't
[07:12] like it move but that's where you're at
[07:16] so so you are you are tested with doing
[07:20] some some process some part of this
[07:25] larger machine okay so what's the
[07:28] optimal strategy there
[07:30] do that part typically that part
[07:33] especially if you're intelligent is not
[07:36] that difficult and what I see a lot of
[07:39] intelligent people do is you know and
[07:41] ambitious people is they go into other
[07:44] places and they say hey I'm gonna fix
[07:46] that hey I'm gonna I'd like to do that
[07:49] how do I know I used to do this for sure
[07:52] and because you say like wow that's not
[07:54] optimal that's not optimal it's not
[07:56] supposed to be optimal that's the whole
[07:58] point it's supposed to be just something
[08:01] that keeps the gears running so they go
[08:04] into this other place and say wow you
[08:06] know the I can I can fix this in uh in
[08:10] the the finance department the finance
[08:12] department doesn't want you there they
[08:14] have their own career they're doing
[08:17] their little part they don't want to get
[08:19] the optimal solution even if they say a
[08:23] thousand times to Sunday that they want
[08:26] this they don't so you're brought in
[08:29] role do that role that role is not that
[08:33] difficult right most of the studies show
[08:36] that that the average person gets about
[08:38] two to four hours of productive work a
[08:42] day that's it that's it and the rest so
[08:46] you can use that data for your advantage
[08:49] you can use that data to know that two
[08:52] to four hours of your work is probably
[08:54] all you're going to get that's
[08:55] productive okay that gives you an awful
[08:57] lot of time to do other stuff right make
[09:01] connections with those people that are
[09:03] going to uh to say yes to a promotion
[09:07] or not because you know internal
[09:10] promotions are much more difficult than
[09:12] external and it depends a bit on the job
[09:14] market but typically that holds over
[09:18] over decades right especially in in in
[09:21] today's job market so so it doesn't do
[09:26] you any good to fight and fight fight
[09:30] for you know for some promotion or some
[09:33] great performance review typically
[09:36] that's usually nepotism that gets you
[09:38] there it's usually somebody it's always
[09:41] always always always always somebody
[09:43] that says I want Joe uh stepping up and
[09:47] being manager I'm going to give Joe a
[09:50] good uh a fat pay rise because I think
[09:53] that she deserves it or he deserves it
[09:56] right so so that that's it right you can
[10:00] you can you can stress out about getting
[10:03] that good performance review but that
[10:05] the performance review is designed it is
[10:08] designed to be just a little bit Out Of
[10:12] Reach so you're always reaching it like
[10:14] a dumb donkey uh going after a carrot
[10:18] that's sticking in front of his head and
[10:20] it's always designed so that you you can
[10:23] never really get it now lots of people
[10:26] do right of course promotion
[10:29] happen lottery winners happen that's the
[10:33] the the the point is even though some
[10:36] people make it up they make it up they
[10:38] make it up through the ranks because
[10:40] somebody says I want this person to be
[10:44] promoted so keep that in mind and if you
[10:47] are if you're looking for other work and
[10:49] all that okay but be very careful about
[10:53] that you are not hired to look for other
[10:56] work you're not hired to get other
[10:58] projects and say oh I can do this this
[11:00] is easy I'm going to do this other thing
[11:03] you nobody wants that and they say they
[11:07] do they say they want go-getters and so
[11:09] they really don't they really don't when
[11:11] it comes down to it you know there are
[11:13] other managers in these other teams
[11:15] they're that think they're doing a great
[11:17] job and oh my God so many people think
[11:20] they're doing a great job and they're
[11:22] not and if you can see it it's
[11:24] annoying my advice is to care less care
[11:29] less about the the the the the perfect
[11:32] or even the good solution and just go
[11:35] with the mediocre solution if you can't
[11:38] do this find something else to do
[11:40] because you're going to be constantly
[11:42] frustrated you're going to be constantly
[11:44] banging up against uh the the the weight
[11:48] of that
[11:49] organization and it is it is a a a
[11:53] totalitarian regime we voluntarily put
[11:57] ourselves into this position because
[11:59] because there not that many Alternatives
[12:01] and there not that many Alternatives
[12:03] that we've actually seen that work but
[12:05] you know capitalism you know that is
[12:08] that
[12:09] is what we do now
[12:13] so it's annoying it's not fun but if you
[12:17] care a bit
[12:19] less your stress level goes down and you
[12:22] can you can spend that time looking for
[12:25] the next job that you're going to
[12:27] do what I do find is in smaller
[12:30] companies startups um and and scale ups
[12:34] and things like that they they are more
[12:37] concerned about finding the right
[12:39] optimal solution they're more concerned
[12:41] about you know they're they're they're
[12:43] more willing to have somebody come in
[12:47] and wear a number of hats and and jump
[12:49] in and fix this and that but they
[12:51] usually don't pay as well and
[12:54] statistically you make less money
[12:56] working in a startup through your career
[12:58] than you would in a large corporation
[13:00] large corporations just have money to
[13:03] spend so they spend it on their
[13:04] employees on the on the the resources
[13:07] the human resources that they have it's
[13:10] kind of like cattle but the startup will
[13:14] give you more intellectual satisfaction
[13:17] but it might probably will not give you
[13:20] statistically speaking will not give you
[13:23] the monetary uh rewards that a large
[13:26] corporation will give you so it's a
[13:28] tradeoff you can start your own company
[13:30] and then you start your own
[13:31] authoritarian regime and you're at the
[13:33] top that's possible but if you have VCS
[13:36] you're not at the top they're at the top
[13:38] so it is it is it is a funny situation
[13:42] and the people that I see that that that
[13:45] rise to the ranks right and and and tend
[13:48] to be you know a bit smarter than
[13:50] average but the the the ones that I see
[13:54] that actually rise to the ranks they
[13:57] care less they they they focus on what
[14:00] the company wants them to do in that Cog
[14:02] role and they just optimize that that's
[14:05] it and and they if you can optimize that
[14:09] and do well that and make your manager
[14:11] look good things go better for you
[14:14] things go well and they make friends
[14:16] they make friends because most jobs are
[14:19] found by networking they're not found on
[14:21] LinkedIn they're not found on you know
[14:24] on on Monster if that's still a thing or
[14:26] dice or whatever they're found because a
[14:29] friend is like hey would you would you
[14:31] like to uh you know I know this this
[14:33] company that's looking for these uh type
[14:36] of people and and would you like to do
[14:38] that that's how most jobs are found
[14:39] especially in White Collar so you're
[14:42] better off you are better off being at
[14:45] the water
[14:46] cooler that's not a thing anymore but
[14:49] the you you know that is to talk with
[14:51] other colleagues get to know them get
[14:53] people to like
[14:55] you and maximize that Cog part don't go
[14:59] for other projects unless you really
[15:02] know that this is going to be
[15:04] self-serving and just shut off this idea
[15:06] of fairness of of equity you know that
[15:11] meritocracy oh it is such double speak
[15:14] that companies put you through to you
[15:17] know to say like oh we're a meritocracy
[15:20] and yet they cannot there's not a
[15:22] company that I found that's able to to
[15:25] adequately measure
[15:27] productivity never seen them and I done
[15:29] Consulting dozens and dozens of
[15:31] companies I've I've worked in a number
[15:33] of large and small
[15:35] corporations at all it's always about
[15:38] somebody's opinion of you so the optimal
[15:41] the people that I see that actually rise
[15:44] to the ranks myself included is just
[15:47] about making friends optimizing that one
[15:51] little Cog which is by Design pretty
[15:54] easy if you're intelligent if you're
[15:56] competent it is pretty easy to optimize
[16:00] that and it gets super boring so
[16:02] actually if you're very smart after a
[16:04] year or two of optimizing that you're
[16:07] bored anyway if you're not then you know
[16:10] maybe that's the the position of uh of
[16:13] incompetence for you that's the place
[16:15] where you should be the Peter Principle
[16:17] I think you get promoted to the the
[16:19] point of your incompetence which I I
[16:21] kind of believe kind of don't but um
[16:26] but yeah that is that is the the optimal
[16:29] strategy put that aside put it aside to
[16:33] get promoted to get the good per and and
[16:37] do those two to four hours a day that it
[16:39] takes you to do that uh that that Cog
[16:42] work um emails right don't let the the
[16:47] Urgent uh go over the important most
[16:50] emails don't really don't matter and
[16:52] most most corporations it's it's absurd
[16:55] depends on the company but
[16:57] typically 's only a very small amount of
[17:00] the work that actually matters really
[17:04] the the rest is is kind of fluff to to
[17:06] make people look
[17:07] good so care a bit less your stress
[17:11] levels will go down things will go a bit
[17:14] smoother for you um you might not have
[17:17] this idea this this imaginary idea that
[17:20] you're going to get
[17:22] promoted put that aside it's in your
[17:25] imagination now you can fight all you
[17:28] want for this up to you i' I've done all
[17:32] I've done all kinds of strategies within
[17:34] companies and I've I've mentored people
[17:36] that are doing different
[17:39] strategies honestly that whole
[17:41] performance review and stuff there is a
[17:43] whole formula for them to to bring
[17:45] people up and they're they're not so
[17:47] inclined to do it they're not inclined
[17:49] to give everybody a great performance
[17:51] review there's a there's a bell curve
[17:53] that they they want things to go on and
[17:55] it's not about marit it's not about your
[17:59] productivity in that company it's about
[18:01] somebody saying yes this person is the
[18:04] uh is the the top 5% and that person
[18:08] typically doesn't want to be threatened
[18:10] by you right that person does not want
[18:13] to be you know see you as a threat the
[18:16] other thing is I see that that um some
[18:19] people get into into fights internally
[18:22] to try and get the best solution this is
[18:24] a terrible terrible strategy I'm not
[18:27] talking fist fights I'm talking about
[18:29] about you know coming up against some
[18:32] other other group that's doing a really
[18:34] bad job this is never a good strategy
[18:37] you will get you will get yourself fired
[18:40] before anything and and everybody will
[18:42] look at you as the bad person especially
[18:45] if this has been tolerated for some
[18:47] period of time the company doesn't care
[18:50] if they did they would have gotten rid
[18:52] of it it's a it's an organism the the
[18:55] corporation's an organism if it if
[18:57] there's some foreign body that's causing
[18:59] trouble then it will it will expel that
[19:03] foreign body don't be that foreign body
[19:06] until you're two years are up and then
[19:07] go look for another job get to another
[19:10] position and then move on from there
[19:13] okay so I'm sure you know I'm sure I'm
[19:15] going to hear comments of like you know
[19:17] oh you're just bitter because you know
[19:19] you you didn't do this that no I'm not
[19:22] bitter at all I've had a wonderful
[19:24] career and I've I've you know been
[19:26] promoted I've switched jobs I've I've
[19:28] done startup the the whole thing
[19:30] everything I wanted to do in a career so
[19:33] this is just my advice is that you know
[19:35] that I that I have I'm talking to many
[19:37] many mentores and uh and other you know
[19:41] counseling uh things that I do and it
[19:44] helps helps a lot so I hope this helps
[19:47] you and uh and if you want to like And
[19:50] subscribe this is the kind of thing we
[19:52] talk about here and uh I am hoping that
[19:55] you are having a wonderful time I hope
[19:57] that you have a job that you really love
[19:59] and that it's uh it's low stress and
[20:02] you're really enjoying it and I will see
[20:05] you on the next one bye
